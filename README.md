# jhc

hc is a Haskell compiler that aims to produce the most efficient programs possible via whole program analysis and other optimizations. It also performs well as a cross compiler and is able to generate Windows programs on a Linux box, or target embedded systems with little effort. The compiler cannot, however, be compiled on Windows.
